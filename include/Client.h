 * Client - Parent class for student's TCP client

 *  	   ~Client(Dest): no cleanup required in parent
 *
 *  	   connectTo - your overloaded function should establish a connection to a server
 *                   with the given IP address and port
 *  	   handleConnection - your overloaded function should loop to handle both user
 *                          input from stdin (sending it to the server) and data sent
 *                          by the server itself
 *  	   closeConn - Your overloaded function should cleanly close the connection
 *  	   
 *  	   Exceptions: sub-classes should throw a std::exception with the what string field
 *  	               populated for any issues.
